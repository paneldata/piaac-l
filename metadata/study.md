## Study info

PIAAC-L is the follow-up project of PIAAC will run from 1st July 2013 to December 31st 2017. The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), was carried out 2011/2012 on behalf of the OECD, examines the basic skills that are necessary for adults to participate successfully in society and working life.  Within the scope of PIAAC-L three further survey waves are beeing conducted (2014-2015-2016) with corresponding longitudinal data sets that will be available for the scientific community. 

## Method

The project is planned to consist of three survey waves (in 2014, 2015, 2016) with different focal points. This will involve use of the SOEP core survey instruments (both individual and household questionnaires), PIAAC instruments (competency measurement and background questionnaire), and competency tests from NEPS and SOEP. In the first survey wave, only the SOEP survey instruments have been used (household and individual questionnaires). Information on the familiar background, household and retrospective biographical information on partnership and work history is collected. The focus of the second survey wave (2015) is on health, education, spare time and partnership as well as on tasks conducted at the working environment and interviewees do PIAAC and NEPs test items. The third wave will focus on measuring the competencies of all household members based on the short scales used in the SOEP in 2006 and 2012 on basic cognitive skills. The surveys are aimed at comparative methodological analysis of the competency indicators used in PIAAC, NEPS, and SOEP and innovative analysis of labor market, education, and socio-political issues.

## Data access

PIAAC-L data are not available yet. The first PIAAC-L SUF will presumably be available October 2015 and will be distributed by GESIS. 

### Data description

Not yet defined. 

## Study units

PIAAC-L is a cooperative project of GESIS, the National Educational Panel Survey (NEPS) at the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi), and the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) at DIW Berlin, whose aim is to convert the PIAAC study into a longitudinal study with three waves.
